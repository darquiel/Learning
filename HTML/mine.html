    <h2>BIO</h2>
    <p>Marks career in technology has been a varied one, over the last 20 years he 
    has held several different positions ranging from customer service, to quality assurance.  
    Throughout all of these positions the responsibility of configuration management and build 
    management has always fallen either to Mark personally or to one of the groups that he managed; 
    because of his 'keeping a hand in' management style he has been involved closely with the 
    scripting and automation framework for this area.  
    Creating scripted frameworks that intercommunicate across machine / 
    operating system / domain boundaries is a passion for him.
